26,Cora Carleson,"Bio’s are hard to write because my mom always said “don’t talk about yourself all the time”.  So I will give this a try.  
Real Estate wasn’t my first career.  When my children were young, I worked as an illustrator for a children’s magazine.  I then branched out into books, while still drawing for the magazine, and also some graphic work.  It was really fun and creative and I loved it.  I especially loved being able to work from home, and this was long before the internet!  
That company was sold to a Canadian company and I began to work more for myself doing graphic design and advertising, still working from home.  
My husband was a general contractor and many times I would draw renderings for him or design house plans.  I love to design plans, I imagine where my furniture would go and what colors I would use.  It’s just fun for me.  But I noticed that when I would design his plans, those he hired to sell his homes, weren’t selling them for how I designed them.  That was important to me, so I told him I was going to get my real estate license and sell his homes myself!  
So here we are 20 plus years later, selling much more than just his homes, but also multi-unit properties, land and some commercial as well.  So I guess you could call me the “Accidental Realtor”.  
I love this job too, I love the people I work with and I love the flexibility and creativity required.  Seems strange that this is a creative career but it is.  There are so many different loan programs out there to meet all your specific needs, and being able to put them all together with the right house is just so satisfying! Really!
But now, I am grateful that I have this wonderful team that pulls everything together to meet the needs of our clients!  
Tara Kerr, Realtor, wife, mom and “DYS freak” is a sales associate and also lists properties herself.  She handles all our paperwork, schedules our appointments and is our liaison with the title companies and mortgage companies.  

When you list your home with us, she will be the one you hear from when someone wants to show your house, orders title reports and inspection reports, let the appraiser into your home and all the other multitude of tasks that need to be done.  
Or if you are the buyer, she will map out our showings for us to they are most efficient, you will hear from her to verify appointment times and she will coordinate all the different people in the transaction. 
When you use her to represent you in a sale, she will show you around the neighborhoods, helping you choose just the right spot, listen to your wants and needs and dreams and have some great ideas on how to make your new home, yours!
Jonny Knutson, Realtor, wife, mom and grandma!  There is nothing better than being a grandmother!  I should know, I have several of the little angels myself! Jonny brings years of experience working with Military families.  We are so blessed here to have such a strong military presence.  And with that comes some pretty specific needs for those families.  We are ready to help! Jonny understands all the ins and outs of being a military wife and can help you with what you are looking for.  There are some great loan programs out there for military guys and gals.  Sometimes, we can stack loan programs to get you into the house the you need for your family.
Lalia Bunn is our Marketing director.  She is also a wife, mom and a tri-athlete! She is in charge of making sure our ads for all our listings are being presented in the best light, on the web or in print.  She hires professional photographers to take photos of our listings.  She works with the magazines we use to advertise your property, Homes and Land Magazine and the Real Estate Book. Both are wonderful resources and everyone seems to pick them up when sitting down at a restaurant.  She also does our internet marketing, MLS listing marketing and Facebook and other social media.  We try to use all types of marketing to get that home out there in front of everyone who is interested – and of those who aren’t too!

38,Mark Masley,"I grew up in Huntington Beach, California which is about an hour south of Los Angeles in Orange County. My family’s home was in Huntington Harbor, a series of man?made islands accessed from the Pacific Ocean by a large channel. As a result, much of my childhood and teen years were spent on the water; surfing, sailing, swimming and rowing.

I met my wife, Tanya, while I was living in San Diego. She was a professional event planner who had relocated to San Diego from Anchorage, so a few years after we were married, we decided that Anchorage would be a wonderful place to raise a family. We made the trip north in June of 2001 and have never regretted it for a moment. We have two wonderful children: Our son, Andrew, is seventeen years old, loves playing basketball for Dimond High School and working on his truck. Our daughter, Lauren, is nearly fourteen years old and aspires to play volleyball for DHS when she starts in the Fall. Both of our children are in the public school system here in Anchorage, which Tanya and I consider excellent. We both take an active role in their school lives as board members on the Dimond High PTSA.

I began my career in real estate in 1984 (36 years ago!). I spent the first 5 years in commercial syndication and brokerage and made the transition to residential sales after selling my company in 1989. Since then, I have personally handled hundreds of real estate transactions, and have also experimented with building and running a real estate related internet company.

I started with RE/MAX in 2003, and recently returned to the company after spending a brief time away at another real estate firm. I am a firm believer in the power of the brand and the professional standards it represents. I love the real estate profession, and I served my colleagues as president of the Anchorage Board of REALTORS® in 2016, and as president of the Alaska Association of REALTORS® in 2019.  I was the 2016 REALTOR® of the Year, and I continue to support the REALTOR® organization as they advocate for the rights of private property owners like you and me.

I look forward to meeting you and helping you achieve your real estate goals.

I played college football at Pacific Lutheran University from 2003 - 2005. I was coached by one of the all-time greatest, Frosty Westering, who ranks among the most winning coaches in football. His positive teachings and influence in my life played a massive role in my success.

I served in the US Army on Active Duty from 2005 - 2013 as an MP Officer. I then worked in the pharmaceutical sales industry for a short period, then found my true passion in real estate sales and marketing.

17,Scott Myers,"â€œKnowledge is Powerâ€? is a phase Scott learned from the first Broker he worked for and it stuck. Scott started his real estate career in Central Oregon at the age of 18. In order to gain his clientsâ€™ confidence and trust, he soon learned he needed to be as knowledgeable as seasoned REATLORSÂ®. He immersed himself in learning market statistics, inventory, and real estate license law. In the winter of 2012, after a successful real estate career in Oregon, Scott sought adventure and change which led him to Alaska. Initially, he worked for a land development company, including managing several new home projects. He was then recruited to be the managing broker of a real estate office, (where he lives), in Eagle River. â€œSuccess is the result of how hard you are willing to work and how much knowledge you haveâ€? â€“ another quote Scott never forgets. He notes it is critical to stay ahead of the trends. Ultimately, home buyers and sellers are impacted by local and national markets. Scott credits his active involvement in the National Association of REALTORSÂ® for giving him an edge in the industry. He learned early on that back to the profession is vitally important to oneâ€™s success. Scott has served on the Anchorage Board of REALTORSÂ® for the past 7 years, both as Director at Large and then as 2017 President. Scott has served on the Executive Board of The Alaska Association of REALTORSÂ® and currently serves as the Alaska representative for REALTORÂ® Political Action Committee (RPAC), Major Investor Council for the National Association of REALTORSÂ®. Throughout his career, Scott has been recognized for his hard work and dedication to his profession. He was featured on the Discovery Channelâ€™s Buying Alaska in 2014. In 2015, he was named 30 Under 30 by REALTORÂ® Magazine and in 2016 he was featured on the cover of Top Agent Magazine . Scott is one of five Alaska REALTORSÂ® who was granted membership in the prestigious Presidentâ€™s Circle by the National Associate of REALTORSÂ®. Presidentâ€™s Circle membership allows him access to their annual conference. In 2017, Scott was awarded REALTORÂ® of the Year by the Anchorage Board of REALTORSÂ®. Scott believes in playing just as hard as he works. He attends quarterly National Associate of REALTORSÂ® conferences which are held around the country. His international travels include: Africa, Central America, Europe, South America, and his favorite vacation hot spot, Aruba, several times. His summer travel plans include another visit to Europe.",http://www.myeagleriver.net,http://ap.rdcpix.com/3760642416/6d34b91ab69dc1978250b2e06fbb4d15a-b0s.jpg,,0,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Scott-Myers_Eagle-River_AK_3291572_486189998,scottmyers@gci.net,,3,129000,195000,0,0,0,"11525 Old Glenn Hwy,Eagle River,99577,AK,US",RE/MAX Dynamic Properties - Eagle River Branch,(907) 694-4200,(907) 280-8010,(907) 302-4583,Eagle River

During the home buying process, I will challenge myself to exceed your expectations through in depth industry knowledge and incredible service. As your representative, the trust placed in me is something I recognize and value. Integrity and your interests are always at the forefront of every transaction I am involved with.

I grew up in a small farming and ranching community in Western Colorado where I owned and operated my own business in the local industry. I was involved in many real estate transactions through leased properties as well as buying and selling property myself. My involvement in these transactions spurred an interest in me so great, it led to my current career.

My career as a real estate professional began in Denver, Colorado where I worked with residential investors. This opportunity gave me a keen insight and knowledge into the real estate industry that allows me to better serve your interests, whether you are an investor or looking for a home of your own.

My wife is originally from Anchorage. When we began a family of our own, she knew there was no place to raise children like Alaska. After making trips to visit her family, and through my wife’s persistence, I too had become captured by Alaska’s uniqueness and beauty. Now, I cannot imagine living anywhere else.

In my free time, you will catch me taking full advantage of the incredible and adventurous lifestyle Alaska has to offer. I love the outdoors and am always looking to experience something new.

8,Tonya Bailey,"What better place to help others with their Real Estate needs than in beautiful ALASKA. It’s a pleasure to put others in the home of their dreams or help them sell to move on to new dreams.

My BA in Communication along with several years of property management and operations experience give me a strong customer service basis which ultimately mimics The Golden Rule. Finding or selling a home goes way beyond an accepted offer; it’s the entire transaction and I pride myself in being available and dialed in for my clients from start to finish. I’m dedicated because I love what I do and forming relationships in the process is a perk I value. 

I’m sensitive to what life brings— job transfers, new babies, military PCS’s, uncoupling, or familial matters. Working hard to provide the best service at all times AND with the highest level of integrity as if it were my own home purchase? Yes, it’s that simple and it comes naturally to me. I fully understand the emotions involved in home ownership so you can feel confident your best interests are at hand.

I believe there are so many benefits to home ownership and real estate is one of the most valuable investments people can make. The process of buying or selling a home can be intimidating, stressful, and confusing - especially in today’s competitive market. My job is to guide you through this process and make it a good experience!  

I was born and raised in Alaska. Alaska is an amazing place to live and adventure. I spend my free time with my husband and kiddos. Together we like to snow machine, ski, boat, bike... If its an activity involving snow or sunshine we are happy campers!

The experience of purchasing our family's first home and income property sparked my interest in real estate and has ultimately led to my career as a Realtor®.

18,Victoria Roberts,"""All we can strive to be is the absolute best possible version of ourselfs.""

I came to call Alaska home when my family moved here in the Air Force in the early 80's. We finally settled in Eagle River and I went to Chugiak High School, From there I went to a trade school in computers and worked my way to becoming a Realtor in 2004 then to a Broker in 2011.

I pride myself on knowledge and knowing when to leverage as I have sold real estate in all of our market shifts and I know you have to be on your game and with that is constant education. I love getting the maximum best results for my clients and to this day I learn and grows from each one.

I am a proud mother to awesome crazy blended family of 7 ranging in years and I know the stress of the day to day juggles of work, family and moving. I pride myself in being able to help make any real estate transaction as smooth as possible no matter where you are in life. 

Most of my days are spent with clients, marketing or showing homes, going over their transactions by negotiating and looking over numerous reports.

Such as disclosures, inspections, appraisals and title to safe guard and protect clients along with looking for any hiccups I can eliminate before it is a issue. I enjoy putting that SOLD sign up for sellers and handing keys to clients to their new home. When I am done with that you will find me with my family and friends enjoying the back yard we call Alaska by camping, hiking or sitting by the fire any thing outdoors to keep the soul going.

14,Paula Laird,"Paula moved with her husband, Vic, to Kodiak in 2005 when their family was transferred by the U.S. Coast Guard. Moving to an island with a housing market far different from what they were accustomed to was daunting, even though they had frequently bought and sold homes in their prior duty stations.

In 2008, Paula became an Alaska real estate licensee and learned that the Kodiak housing market, although extremely active, was not so scary. When Vic retired from the Coast Guard in 2010, it was an easy decision to stay in Kodiak. Over the last decade, Paula has developed a reputation for service that garnered her “Best Realtor of the Year” recognition by readers of the Kodiak Daily Mirror and she enjoys the majority of her clientele as referrals from prior satisfied customers. Paula opened RE/MAX of Kodiak in 2012 and transitioned to an independent office, Kodiak Island Real Estate, in the Fall of 2020. She has been blessed beyond measure with a thriving real estate practice and enjoys serving Kodiak families with the highest level of integrity and professionalism that you expect when dealing with a real estate professional.",http://www.KodiakIslandRealEstate.com,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1260995909/83a651cd0da78830235089286c892526a-c0s.jpg,,0,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Paula-Laird_KODIAK_AK_1217238_798989798,paulal@gci.net,,3,29000,750000,0,0,0,"204 E REZANOF DR STE 101,KODIAK,99615,AK,US",Kodiak Island Real Estate,,(907) 942-0444,,KODIAK

6,,"Brenda Davids was born in Wisconsin and moved to Fairbanks, Alaska in 1981 where she attended the University of Alaska Fairbanks. She went on to the University of Alaska Anchorage where she fell in love with the Mat-Su Borough where she currently resides. 
 
Brenda is passionate about helping others, especially her clients. Whether it is home sellers or first-time home buyers, she makes sure the process is seamless on all sides of the transaction. Her favorite part of the transaction is witnessing the joy she brings to her clients throughout the experience. She knew from her very first home sale that real estate would be her lifelong career.
 
Brenda is a hard-working, self-driven and successful REALTOR who specializes in the Mat-Su Valley. 

She absolutely loves Alaskan winters – snowmachining, big snowflakes and sitting by warm fires.  The outdoor fun of Alaskan summers is what makes her heart beat, even after 38 years here in this beautiful state.

17,Kevin Barrett,"Hello, I'm Kevin Barrett, I am  an Associate Broker with REMAX/Dynamic Properties in Anchorage (and surrounding areas) and team leader of The Barrett Real Estate Group. I'm a life-long resident of Anchorage and currently live on Hillside with my wife and children. When I'm not working (which is seldom!) I enjoy golfing, fishing, snow machining, and traveling.

Prior to working in real estate, I worked full-time as a marketing and membership representative for Costco Wholesale while completing my BA in Business Marketing at the University of Alaska, Anchorage. Upon completion of my degree, I worked at General Communications Inc. (GCI) in Customer Service Management and Sales. During my 7+ years at GCI, I managed the company's Anchorage retail operations, call center, business customer service and other various departments and teams under the Marketing and Customer Service umbrella of the company.

As time passed, I began to realize what really motivated me was helping...helping solve problems for people...making things easier for them and helping them get what they need and want.

Several family members were involved in real estate, and it had always been a strong interest of mine. I finally decided to take the plunge and become a part of this ever-changing, challenging and important industry in 2005.

Since that time, I'm happy to say that determination, drive, and genuine commitment to helping others has resulted in helping countless families achieve their real estate goals and earned me ""Top Producer"" status for the last 5 years.

I'm a member of the Anchorage MLS, Anchorage Board of Realtors, Alaska Association of Realtors, and a member of the National Board of Realtors.

I look forward to getting to know you and your family, and helping you all achieve your real estate and home ownership dreams and goals.",http://thebarrettrealestategroup.com,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/a01692d5e-m0l.jpg,,0,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Kevin-Barrett___1500598_604979998,kbarrett@gci.net,,1,460000,460000,0,0,0,"11127 OLD EAGLE RIVER RD # 105,EAGLE RIVER,99577,AK,US","Exp Realty, Llc",,(907) 250-7509,,EAGLE RIVER

These two jobs enable me to have an outstanding work ethic along with an ability to solve the toughest of problems. I strongly feel that throughout my life, I have developed extensive knowledge of the area and have acquired many contacts that will greatly assist you should you be interested in buying or selling your home or property.


This year I have received the nation’s most widely recognized real estate designation, GRI. REALTORS® with the GRI designation (Graduate REALTORS® Institute) have in-depth training in legal and regulatory issues, technology, professional standards, the sales process of real estate, and so much more. These GRI classes were held over a six month period in Anchorage and Wasilla and were taught by some of the most knowledgeable real estate professionals in Alaska. I was the only REALTOR® on the entire Kenai Peninsula to attend all of the classes.


So, if you're considering buying or selling a home, or know someone who is, I strongly encourage you to give me a call. As a REALTOR®, I abide by a strict code of ethics, am held to a higher standard than other real estate professionals, and must stay current with all the updates in regulations, laws, contracts and practices.

She is currently ranked in the top producers at her company and closed approximately 7 million in sales in 2016.  The use of creative marketing in both traditional ways and in combination with new, innovative social media use sets her business apart.  Michele developed her Signature Digital Open House to allow people to “shop” from the comfort of online prior to going for a traditional home tour, this has greatly decreased length of time on market and helped happy home buyers find the right one for them.

This style of customer service in conjunction with her “go getter” attitude makes it easy for you to refer your friends and family to her as well. She understands that buying/selling your home is one of the biggest financial decisions most people will ever make and she takes that very seriously. 

When not actively selling homes, Michele can be found spending time with family and friends.  As a wife, mother of two grown children and mother-in-law with four beautiful grandchildren she keeps busy!  She can be found at the hockey rink, basketball court or soccer fields cheering on her grandchildren.  Michele is an avid travel bug!  If there is a chance for travel and adventure you can bet she will be there.  Keeping current and volunteering in her community is very important to her.  Too whom much is given, much is required. Michele is the current Vice President of the Big Lake Chamber of Commerce, in this position she assists in helping her local economy grow and volunteers to make it a great place for the residents to continue to live and thrive.

19,Rachel McIlvain,"She Lives It!
Rachel has lived in the Wasilla area since age 5. She loves the roots she has grown and is always looking for ways she can contribute to improve the community she lives in. She began working in the real estate industry volunteering as a receptionist at age sixteen. She bought her first piece of Alaska when she was eighteen. It later became her very first listing as an Alaskan real estate licensee. She has earned a GRI designation and continues to educate herself constantly to better serve her clients.
She Loves It!
She has a wonderful husband and 5 kids that keep her busy in her off time. She loves to spend time with them snowboarding, snow-machining, hiking, biking, fishing, camping, and pretty much any thing to do with enjoying her family and Alaska. She always tells her kids to look around and enjoy it because there is no other place like it. Although she loves to get her beach time in while traveling she loves the feeling of coming back to Alaska where she will always call home.
She Sells It!
Rachel is an accomplished Mat-Su Valley Realtor who brings a strategic yet personable approach to the home buying and home selling process. Drawing from many years of experience Rachel has built a reputation for her customer care and proven ability to guide buyers to obtain the best value for their dream home and to assist sellers to a smooth, stress-free sale of their real estate. As an experienced licensee, Rachel understands that buying and selling is one of the biggest decisions in a client’s life and that it can be very stressful.
As a full time Realtor, she will work hard to lower your stress level and make your experience as pleasurable as possible. She will accomplish this through constant communication, and by being accessible whenever you need her. Ongoing communications and personal contact, market updates and staying on top of the sales process provides the best possible experience for buyers and sellers. Making sure that the process is smooth and seamless is the cornerstone of her success. She understands what it is like to stand in her clients’ shoes. Several times she has been involved in buying and selling houses of her own this has afforded her a sensitivity towards her clients’ journey, which can be attributed to the first-had perspective she gained through her personal experiences.
Rachel strives to maintain long-term relationships with clients and help them make wise financial decisions with their real estate purchases. She knows how to listen, is generous in offering information, and more importantly, knows when to stop talking. Her main intention is to understand her client’s needs and build a relationship that will last over the course of time. When orchestrating deals for her buyers and sellers, Rachel is assertive and effective without being too aggressive. While she is a strong negotiator and advocate for her clients, she is just as much a compassionate and friendly partner who eases a process that can often be quite stressful. Whether you want a existing or new construction home in town or a remote off the grid cabin, Rachel knows everything there is to know about locations, value, property types, pricing, building requirements and zoning – not to mention every possible attraction to entertain you and your family. She thoroughly loves her work, and enjoys the fantastic people she meets every day – many of whom become her neighbors and friends. Every transaction, she believes, is always about her customer!

7,Matt Steele,"My family moved to Alaska in 1989, when I was 10 years old. My dad was in the Air Force and I think he followed where his sense of adventure took him and that is how he ended up here. We lived on Lazy Mountain in Palmer and even as recently as that, the Mat Su Valley was a small collective of towns with wide open lands between them. No one who was around back then would imagine the size of life here now. I attended Butte Elementary and was in the first class of 6th graders at Palmer Junior Middle School, just after it had been changed from Palmer Junior High School. Two years into high school at Palmer, my family moved to Delta Junction and after graduation my exploring phase of my life began.

I lived in Fairbanks from 1997 until 2000. My time there was not much different than most individual's lives directly out of high school with the exception of my wanderlust. I have many fond memories of Chena Hot Springs visits as well as random trips up the Elliott and Dalton highways, down to Southcentral to Chitna, Valdez, and Homer, and even random trips down the Alcan just because it was there. Like most young people, I had a thirst for adventure and although I didn't know it at this young age, the seemingly random trips that I made around the state at whim would set the tone for my adult adventures that I now dream of and live as much as I can. Because I thought my sense of adventure was so big though, I had bigger plans. I joined the US Coast Guard.

My brief time in the US Coast Guard lasted from 2000 until 2003. My favorite patrols that I went on were our ""Alpat"" patrols that we did in the Bering Sea. On these patrols we did search and rescue standby for the crabbing vessels that participated in the fishery that was later featured in the show 
""The Deadliest Catch"". My experience there and visitations to Unalaska could only be described as awesome, using the word in the most literal sense. Anyone who has seen the show should know that there is no real way to do the real thing justice, but only because the magnitude of the anger of the sea can not be imagined by a TV audience. Dutch Harbor itself is also a fascinating place, with still-existing World War II emplacements existing on the beaches. I look forward to visiting again with my family.

When I returned to Alaska in 2003 permanently, I knew that I was home. My wife Stephanie, my two daughters, my son, and I all immensely enjoy the outdoors. Everything and anything outdoors is our favorite thing to do. We currently live in the Meadow Lakes area outside of Wasilla. We couldn't possibly be any happier with the life we live here in the Mat Su Valley. It is truly paradise. We have year round fishing, aviation in our own back yard, off road ATV adventures, and hiking at any time. What in the world could anyone ever want more?

If you too have a thirst for adventure like I do then give me a call today or shoot me an email, even if it is just to see what we have planned for this next weekend.",http://www.lastfrontierhomes.com,http://p.rdcpix.com/v02/a26662000-c0l.jpg,,0,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Matt-Steele_Wasilla_AK_2123302_779819698,msteele1979@gmail.com,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Matt-Steele-Century-21-Realty-Solutions/844812075585513,5,390000,585000,0,0,0,"1689 S KNIK GOOSE BAY RD STE 100,WASILLA,99654,AK,US",Century 21 Realty Solutions,(907) 355-8455,(907) 244-4343,,WASILLA

24,Russell Joyce and Associates,"With 30 years in Alaska, Russell Joyce has extensive knowledge about life on the Last Frontier. Alaska is a growing frontier state with limited infrastructure and private land. We cherish our lifestyles and freedoms as do most Americans with added Alaskan touches; Savoring the beautiful scenery everywhere you go; enjoying the recreational opportunities; and providing for our families from the bountiful harvests found in Alaska. Where you choose to place yourself in Alaska's vastness is your choice. Many of us choose the Matanuska-Susitna Valley in SouthCentral Alaska due to it's proximity to that listed above, and much more, as well as closeness to Anchorage for work, entertainment, and travel. Our Mat-Su Valley, as it is know, is the size of West Virginia and stretches from the Knik Arm of Cook Inlet and the Chugach Mtns. on the South and West to the Alaska Range the with Denali National Park on the Northern Border and as far as East as Lake Louise and Nelchina.  Recreational activities for all seasons is on the menu with summertime fishing, camping, hiking and climbing, ATV riding and much much more.  Fall hunting and fishing are the main theme before giving way to winter skiing and snowboarding, snowshoeing and snow-machining (there is little snowmobiling here and until you experience Alaska riding you won't know what I mean) and tons of other cold climate activities.  We all look forward to spring with an awakening of the hours of light and the activities to match and it all starts over again. Mentioning the amount of light we experience from March to September is wonderous as the amount of activity matches the time to do it all with long daylight hours.  The opposite must be said about the fall and winter as the limited daylight leaves little time to accomplish those activites we look forward to doing when the snow flies.  
Alaskan living is much the same elsewhere in the state but here in the Mat-Su our young community is growing and vibrant. We are spreadout with subdivisions that typically enjoy 1/2 to 1 acre lots around central communities with ample mix of local shops and national chains for shopping and dining.  Schools are well placed within the communities and more are planned and in the process of getting built.  Jobs are continuing to be added in our area, although Anchorage will always have a substantial number of cummuters from the Mat-Su Valley. Those that commute see a continual progress in the infrastructure that allows them to work in Anchorage and enjoy the rural lifestyle associated with the Mat-Su Valley.  Around the central areas of Palmer and Wasilla are the more distant commuties of Big Lake, Willow, and Talkeetna to the North as well as Sutton, Chickaloon, and Matanuska Glacier to the East. All of these areas stretch beyond the typical commute areas although there are some whom drive to Anchorage regularly for their work.  
Home price ranges are at or slightly above the national averages and Alaska wages are well above national averages.  Our nearest neighbor, Anchorage, has home prices that average 30% to 40% higher for the same home on less land, which explains the growth we experience and will continue to experience in the Mat-Su Valley. 
Population growth from 60,000 in 2000 census to a little over 80,000 in 2010 census has it's pitfalls but also comes with opportunity. Development of our resources in the Mat-Su Valley is on the verge of expansions with a new Port at Point McKenzie and soon a rail line extension to that port.  Resources are why Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867 and why it was admitted as a state in 1959.  However, resource development in Alaska is miniscule given the size of the state and barely visible here in the Mat-Su Valley.  We welcome responsible development of our resources within the context of preserving the intristic beauty and wonders that are inherent in Alaska. That is not to say other residents share my view and political divisions are generally split 50/50 on development, so most are slow to happen.  Given these checks and balances I believe the Mat-Su Valley is an ideal place to live with lots of economic opportunity and a lifestyle not found in most areas of the country.  
If you find any of this of interest to you please visit my website or send me an email or give me a call, I'd love to share what I can about life in the Mat-Su Valley and on the Last Frontier.",http://www.russelljoyce.com/listings.asp,http://p.rdcpix.com/v02/adee91000-c0l.jpg,,0,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Russell-Joyce-and-Associates_WASILLA_AK_1108446_129929698,Russell@RussellJoyce.com,,8,60000,2750000,0,0,0,"357 E PARKS HWY # 200,WASILLA,99654,AK,US",RE/MAX Dynamic of the Valley,(907) 631-5263,,,WASILLA

2022,The Kibe Lucas Team,"My love for adventure is what brought me to Alaska in 1977.  After working in rural Alaska for the telecommunications trade, I became partners in the Sheep Creek Lodge in 1980, after operating the lodge for 12 years, we sold it in 1992.  During that time, I married my wife, Karla, and we now have two wonderful children.

My desire to help others and knowledge of the local area is what led me to become a realtor in 1992.  I served on the Valley Board of Realtors for 6 years.  One of those years, I was elected Board President.  I also received the honor of being elected Realtor of the Year in 2001.  I have earned the real estate designations of ABR (accredited buyer's representative) and GRI (graduate of the REALTOR institute).  I am a licensed broker and am proud to be affiliated with Keller Willliams Realty Alaska Group.  I recently received my Certified Distressed Property Expert designation.  I am particularly proud of this designation because I am now trained to help sellers that are behind in their mortgage payments find a solution to their stressful situation.

I don't take my responsibilities lightly and feel that it is important to give back to my community through participation in local agencies.  I am currently Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Children's Place, which is a nonprofit in the Mat-Su Valley that serves sexually and physically abused children.  I also have the pleasure to be on the Board of Directors for the Knik - Fairview Loop Property Owner's Association.

23,Debbie White,"When you are buying or selling property in today's real estate market, it's important to have confidence and trust in your real estate professional. My commitment as your local REALTOR is to provide you with the specialized real estate service you deserve.  I have lived in Southeast Alaska most of my life.  I've seen our real estate market decline, and I've been working in the industry through the phenomenal growth of the last several years.

My family first came to Juneau in 1941.  They did not stay too long, but we kept coming back.  My parents moved here permanently in the early 1970's.  Almost everyone else is gone now, but I have remained with my husband and two boys.  Juneau is our home, and we love Southeast Alaska.

Recreational opportunities in this area are really what keep us here.  Fishing is a large part of our recreational lives, and business too.  My husband and his father operate a charter boat, the Popeye.  We love to fish, especially during the Golden North Salmon Derby.  Our boat has brought in many scholarship fish for that event, and a few fish that won prizes too.  I placed 24th in 2003, 97th in 2004, and in the last hour of the 3 day event in 2005, I caught the largest fish for 1st place!  Then in 2007, I caught the largest coho in the derby.  Other recreational activities our family enjoy include hiking, kayaking, camping, and hunting.  When the sun comes out, which I assure you it does on occasion, there is no place in the world more beautiful than Alaska.

As a local area expert with knowledge of the communities and remote areas of Southeast Alaska, my objective is to work diligently to assist you in meeting your real estate goals.  These can include homes, condominiums, land, recreational properties, multi-family investment properties, and commercial opportunities.

When you are an informed buyer or seller, you'll make the best decisions for the most important purchase or sale in your lifetime. That's why my goal is to keep you informed on trends in the marketplace using the latest statistics in our local areas. With property values continuing to rise, real estate is a sound investment for now and for the future.  Historically, for the long term, real estate has always been one of the best investments around.

If you are considering buying or selling a home or would just like to have additional information about real estate in your area, please don't hesitate to call or e-mail me.  Real estate is my career.  This is what I do, full time.",http://www.isellalaska.com/,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/a98bd1600-c0l.jpg,,0,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Debbie-White_Juneau_AK_1490328_319984798,debbie@isellalaska.com,https://www.facebook.com/debbie.white.9085,18,15000,1750000,0,0,0,"9110 GLACIER HWY,JUNEAU,99801-8032,AK,US",Southeast Alaska Real Estate,(907) 789-5533,(907) 723-9886,,JUNEAU
17,"Place, Gwendolyn","Hey there! I'm Gwen.
I work with Home Owners and Home Buyers in Juneau, Alaska. These folks are typically looking to buy a home in one of the tightest markets in the country, get the most money for their home on a short timeline, or keep their home after they move and have the piece of mind a property manager brings.

I've been a REALTOR® for over 15 years and I've served more than one hundred families to date. The best praise I've ever received from a client was: ""Gwen's experience and passion for her job are reasons I recommend her to my friends and neighbors."" - Theresa. Helping families market and sell their home for the best price or helping families find their new home and having clients get exactly what they need, is what makes me so proud and drives everything I do! If you're looking for a REALTOR® who has the knowledge to provide you the service you deserve and the experience to get the job done right, I'd love to work with you, too!

In 2010 I was President of my local Southeast Alaska Board of REALTORS® and President of the State Board of the Alaska REALTORS® in 2018, I was chosen 2010/2011 Woman of the Year by the National Association of Professional Woman (NAPW), and in 2014 I took my education and licensing to the next level by attaining my Broker's license for the state of Alaska.
When I'm not helping people buy, sell, or manage real estate properties, I can be found taking care of our many pets that include, dogs, cats and chickens, wishing for snow so that I can be skiing or dreaming about my next family visit to see my sister and her kids in Australia.

17,ZEB MABIE,"Born and raised in the Fairbanks/North Pole area, I'm proud to be an Alaskan. After graduating from North Pole High School and playing Ice Dogs Junior Hockey, I moved East to attend Manhattanville College, where I played collegiate hockey. I worked in construction and landscaping during the summers and graduated with a degree in Finance. 

While I enjoyed the East Coast, my heart was in Alaska. Returning in 2004, I obtained my real estate license and affiliated first with an independent brokerage, then moved on to a couple of national brokerages for a period of years. Now I am a co-owner of Summit Realty Group and the Associated Broker.  We have a great team of professionals and I am very proud of what we have created and what we do!  Our firm has an outstanding reputation for honesty, integrity and service. We maintain a strong online presence and cultivate positive relationships with our affiliates, including various relocation companies that refer their valued clients to us. 

With my background in finance and construction, I have become a strong competitor in the Fairbanks/North Pole market. By offering full service, prompt attention, and firm commitment to my clients, I have achieved sales levels well beyond the national norm. 

I'm enthusiastic about where I live and what I do. Whether you're new to the area or a lifelong Alaskan like me, you can expect professional, quality service from me. I'm committed to your real estate needs. 

Whether its a first time home purchase or the sale of an executive property, I'm dedicated to getting the job done. Check out my testimonials on my personal website, and you'll see why my clients are glad they chose to work with me.

I understand the stresses involved in the home buying process and I will help you make an informed decision so you can feel good about your new home. I have experience in relocating to Alaska as a military spouse, and understand the unique challenges that our military community faces. It is my pledge to make this transaction a positive and informative one. It is my hope that you will continue to ask me to help you achieve all of your future real estate goals.

Professional Experience:
I have been investing in real estate in Alaska since 2005 and have been a property manager and small business owner. I am also a member of the Greater Fairbanks Board of Realtors and a Buyer Specialist since 2012.

Outside Interests:
I enjoy spending time with my family. We pack up the kids every summer and go on camping trips chasing the various salmon runs across the state. My husband loves to fish, but I always catch THE BIG ONE! In winter you can find us ice fishing and snow machining. I also enjoy the quiet of my home, where you will find me sipping coffee, reading a book, or crafting something on my sewing machine.

Personal Information: 
I was raised in the Fairbanks and North Pole areas of Alaska and for 27 years have called the interior my home.  As is common with many families, we found ourselves missing the beauty of Alaska when we had to change duty stations while my husband was in the military. We took the first opportunity to return to Alaska. I now live in North Pole where my husband and I are raising our family.",http://www.cassie.fairbanksalaskahome.com,https://ap.rdcpix.com/134709030/6df75f407fcaef3e398bcf1919b594d7a-c0s.jpg,,0,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Cassie-Leon_Fairbanks_AK_1695873_605184998,cassieleon.srg@gmail.com,,2,130000,325000,0,0,0,"411 4th Avenue Suite 200,Fairbanks,99701,AK,ak,USA",Summit Realty Group,(907) 374-3208,(907) 799-9018,,Fairbanks

3,Heather Weber,"I have lived in the Fairbanks/North Pole area since 2002 with my husband who works for the Bureau of Land Management as a firefighter.  Throughout my years here, I have grown to love Alaska and especially the people who reside here.  While raising our three children, I built my own business as a piano teacher and have been able to be intricately involved in the community.  Many of my clients were military, and I empathize with the frequent moving and necessity to find quality homes. 

As a member of the Greater Board of Realtors, I recently joined Cyclic Properties because of the character and moral fiber of the people that work here.  Honesty and integrity, along with determination and dedication, are philosophies that I have strived for in all aspects of my life, and Cyclic Properties mirrors these qualities.

If you are planning on buying or selling in the Fairbanks/North Pole area, please contact me for personalized customer care.

I am married to a 3rd generation Juneau native, born and raised, and he works as a Fire Chief.  I'm also the proud Mama of a beautiful little girl, Ember, and the cutest French bulldog, Pollyanna.  My current hobbies include spending time with my family, traveling, reading, and volunteering with various organizations.  I am a member of Rotary, the Capital City Fire Auxiliary, and an active donor to local charities, youth activities, the Wounded Warrior Project, and just about every “Go Fund Me” that comes across my path.

Born into a logging family, Kimmi spent many years growing up in a logging camp on Admiralty Island and then moved to Wrangell where she spent the remainder of her school-age years. Kimmi witnessed her family work in a demanding and complex industry, constantly adapting to the unique challenges of Southeast Alaska. This instilled in Kimmi a keen work ethic and resiliency in demanding environments.

Obtaining her license in 2015 was just the beginning. From there she quickly earned her Accredited Buyer’s Representative (ABR®) designation.

Kimmi also spends countless hours studying local market trends to ensure she is prepared to offer the best guidance possible.

Kimmi can’t promise that the buying or selling process will be easy, but you can rest assured in the fact that you have a highly skilled advocate working for you to achieve your homeownership goals.
When Kimmi isn’t hard at work, you can find her spending time with her family. She is the proud wife to a lifelong, Southeast Alaskan contractor and Air Traffic Controller from Ketchikan.

7,Gretchen Powers,"Let's face it – buying and selling Real Estate can be stressful. I work hard to make the experience as smooth as possible so my clients can relax. But it takes more than intelligence, dedication and project management skills to be an exceptional agent. When the rubber meets the road and so much is at stake - it's all about expertly analyzing all of the variables; the people involved, pros and cons of each property, motivation and timing, as well as the market conditions. And then, it comes down to developing the very best strategy and using the art of diplomacy to make everything align. I love my job and the 24/7 commitment it requires is part of that. Nothing makes me happier than working with clients and helping create win/win outcomes so they feel great about one of the biggest personal and financial decisions they will ever make. I can relate.  After a visit to Juneau in 2006, I traded sunny south Florida for a new and exciting life in Alaska. During my free time, I love cooking and spending time with friends and family, my cat, and venturing outdoors to hike, bike, fish or ski to enjoy the unique natural wonders that make living in Alaska the greatest adventure ever.

16,Corry Isabell,"Investing in real estate just makes sense to me.  I have extensive experience in commercial and residential real estate sales and enjoy every aspect of real estate.  After years of assisting buyers and sellers in Juneau, I still get excited to go show properties.  Matching clients to their perfect home or helping them transition to the next chapter of their lives are equally rewarding.  Envisioning what a distressed property could be or how a property will fit its next family is fulfilling to me. Suze Orman says that, “Owning a home is a keystone of wealth…both financial affluence and emotional security.”  I find fulfillment is assisting families accomplish home ownership.
Assisting buyers in purchasing commercial properties that secure their financial futures for generations and provide for Juneau’s community gives me a feeling of accomplishment.  I began my real estate career in commercial real estate twenty-five years ago when I graduated from college.  I enjoy negotiating commercial transaction and seeing them come to fruition.  Commercial real estate is a challenging and tedious practice but great fun as well.
Born and raised in Soldotna, AK my heart loves Alaska.  I earned degrees in Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance and Computer Information Systems from Lee University in Tennessee.  I bring this strong business and professional background to my real estate practice.  I have been living and assisting clients with their real estate needs in Juneau for the last fifteen years and still consider it an honor every time clients allow me to assist them in making their real estate dreams come true.

11,Sharli Arntzen,"I love what I do for a living here.  The Ketchikan and Southeast Alaska real estate market is unique, just like our inter-island coastal environment.  We have limited inventory, and an amazing culture of people that will make the best out of what we have.

I moved to Ketchikan, Alaska in 1988 from Lake Chelan, Washington (where I continue to visit family every summer.) Dedicated to my community from an early age, you may have met me if I babysat your kids, bagged your groceries at A&P, made your coffee (or other yummy beverage) at B & D, or perhaps around town, refereeing soccer games or acting with First City Players. After graduating from Ketchikan High School in ’01, I moved to Cheney, WA to begin (& complete) my secondary education at Eastern Washington University: graduating with a Bachelor’s degree of English with an emphasis in Technical Communications.

After college I returned to Ketchikan with my marketing business (U Need Media Arts,) and picked up a position as the local director for Big Brothers Big Sisters. I was recruited about a year later to the executive director position for a statewide non-profit called Critical Care Incorporated. There I continued to develop my time, business, and management skills. I also taught group fitness classes for over 5 years and decided to follow my passion for helping people achieve their goals. Thus, I started Liberty Fitness, etc in May 2008.

I am now a blessed wife (to Chris,) and mother of 3: Avaka, Cody, and Zerek.  I am as passionate about my work as I am about my family.  I was honored to join the Re/Max of Ketchikan team in June of 2011, where they fostered my learning and growth until 2015, when in June 2015, I earned my Broker’s license and set out to build my team.  If you’re looking to buy or sell a piece of Alaska with a knowledgeable, reliable REALTOR®, call me today.  Whether you’re relocating, transitioning, upgrading or downsizing, I am Ketchikan’s Real Estate Resource.

I have been dealing in property, customer service, and sales related positions throughout the last 10 years; five of those have been in real estate.  I have sold products and services ranging from appliances, cars, and the modest priced homes to million-dollar homes from dirt to completed product. My work with homes and sales began in 2008 when I completed a rewarding internship with College Works Painting as a Branch Manager for Salem, Oregon.  The experience had provided the foundation for customer service, contract negotiation, management, marketing, and sales which had translated directly to real estate. 

After attending Western Oregon University for four years in Business Entrepreneurship, my career in real estate started locally in late 2012 first as a licensee then earned an associate broker’s license in the spring of 2015. It was during that time that I gleaned specific local knowledge about the local housing market and learned the ins-and-outs of the industry. I moved in the fall of 2015 and earned my Managing Broker’s license in the State of Washington. I worked with a New Home Sales Team on listing and selling high-end new construction properties all over the east side of Seattle in Bellevue, Issaquah, Sammamish, Woodinville, and Kirkland, Washington.

Following that experience I returned to my roots in Ketchikan. With the backbone of experience in Ketchikan’s real estate market and further practice in the bustling Seattle market, I will be applying techniques learned from both venues to Alpine Real Estate’s business practices as the Broker and Co-Owner.
